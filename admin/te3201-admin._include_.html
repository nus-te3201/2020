      <li>1900-2000: SE topics for the current week.</li>
      <li>2000-2100: Programming topics for the current week. Those who are already familiar with programming and not interested in learning Python can leave early.</li>
      <li>2100-2130: You can stay back and do exercises for the current week. Approach prof for help as needed.</li>

    <p><strong>Submission Deadline</strong>: Sunday of week 13 (Apr 19th). <mark>Submissions later than the deadline are liable to a late submission penalty</mark>, to be fair to those who submitted on time. But given that you are part time students, the
      late submission penalty will be small (e.g., <code>-1</code> per day).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The deadline for seeking feedback on the project report draft</strong>: week 13 lecture.
        <ul>
          <li>Preferred mode of feedback: in-person (reason: it is hard to give written feedback on diagrams)</li>
          <li>Such feedback will be limited to high-level comments only (reason: the report is graded).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Deliverables</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Source code</strong> of the working program: zip (not rar) the code and submit to LumiNUS<br>name: File name: <code>{YourName}.zip</code> e.g., <code>JunHao.zip</code></li>
      <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: a single .docx (preferred) or a pdf file that follows the template given (template file will be available in LumiNUS).<br> Submission: Upload to LumiNUS. The file name should be your name e.g., <code>JunHao.docx</code></li>
      <li><strong>Demo video</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Record a demo video showcasing the features of your product.</li>
          <li>Use the exact version of the code you submitted (i.e., the demo should match the submitted code exactly).</li>
          <li>Recommended length 7 minutes, max length 10 minutes).</li>
          <li>Audio narration is optional if the demo can be understood without the audio.</li>
          <li>Ensure the video is in a format that can be played by any computer.</li>
          <li>Submission: Name the file with your name (to match the zip and the report file) and upload to LumiNUS.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h1 id="exam">Exam</h1>
  <p>There is no midterm.</p>
  <p>The final exam has two parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Part 1: MCQ questions (1 hour, 30 marks)</li>
    <li>Part 2: Essay questions (1 hour, 30 marks)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both papers will be given to you at the start but you need to <strong>answer Part 1 first</strong> (i.e. MCQ paper). It will be <strong>collected 1 hour after the exam start time</strong> (even if arrived late for the exam). You are free to start part
    2 early if you finish Part 1 early.</p>
  <box type="success">
    <p>You will be given a practice exam paper to familiarize yourself with the exam format.
    </p>
  </box>
  <h2 id="final-exam-part-1-mcq">Final Exam: Part 1 (MCQ)</h2>
  <p><strong>Question format:</strong> Each MCQ question gives you a statement to evaluate.</p>
  <tip-box>
    <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> An example statement</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Testing is a Q&amp;A activity</p>
    </blockquote>
  </tip-box>
  <p>The meaning of answer options are<br>
    <strong><code>A</code></strong>: <code>Agree</code>. If the question has multiple statements, <ins>agree with all of them</ins>.<br>
    <strong><code>B</code></strong>: <code>Disagree</code>. If the question has multiple statements, <ins>disagree with at least one of them</ins><br>
    <strong><code>C</code></strong>, <strong><code>D</code></strong>, <strong><code>E</code></strong>: Not used</p>
  <p><strong>Number of questions: 50</strong></p>
  <p><strong>You will not be allowed to clarify doubts about questions (in Part 1)</strong> by talking to invigilators. This is to be fair to all students as the the part 1 is fast-paced and each question has only two possible answers.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If a question is not clear, you can circle the question number and write your doubt in the exam paper, near the unclear question.</li>
    <li>If your doubt is justified (e.g. there is a typo in the question) or if many students found the question to be unclear, the examiner may decide to omit that question from grading.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Questions in Part 1 are confidential.</strong> You are not allowed to reveal Part 1 content to anyone after the exam. All pages of the assessment paper are to be returned at the end of the exam.</p>
  <p>Some questions have tags e.g., the question below has a tag <strong><code>JAVA</code></strong>. These <strong>tags provide additional context about the question</strong>. In the example below, the tag indicates that the code given in the question is
    Java code.</p>
  <p><strong>There is no negative marking.</strong> Therefore, you are recommended to answer all 50 questions. Even random answers are better than no answer.<br> First 25 correct answers will earn 0.2 marks each. Each correct answer from that point will
    earn 1 mark each. If you answer all questions correctly, you get 30 marks i.e., <code>0.2x25 + 1.0x25</code>.</p>
  <p><strong>Bring the correct type of pencils</strong> (i.e., B1) for marking the OCR form. If you use pens or the wrong type of pencil to mark the OCR form, the machine cannot read your answers.</p>
  <p><strong>You are recommended to fill up the OCR form as you go</strong>, rather than wait to fill all answers in the OCR form at the end. However, only answers marked in the OCR form will be counted for grading.</p>
  <p><img src="/2020/admin/images/contextTag.png"><br></p>
  <p><strong>The paper is open-book</strong>: you may bring any printed or written materials to the exam in hard copy format. However, electronic devices (including smart watches) are not allowed.</p>
  <p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> <strong>Mark the OCR form as you go</strong>, rather than planning to transfer your answers to the OCR form near the end. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: Given there are 50 questions, it will be hard to estimate how much time you need to mass-transfer all answers to OCR forms.</span></p>
  <p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> <strong>Write the answer in the exam paper as well</strong> as marking it in the OCR form. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: It will reduce the chance of missing a question. Furthermore, in case you missed a question, it will help you correct the OCR form quickly.</span></p>
  <p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> We have tried to <strong>avoid deliberately misleading/tricky questions</strong>. If a question seems to take a very long time to figure out,
    you are probably over-thinking it.</p>
  <h2 id="final-exam-part-2-essay">Final Exam: Part 2 (Essay)</h2>
  <p>Unlike in part 1, <strong>you can ask invigilators for clarifications</strong> if you found a question to be unclear in part 2.</p>
  <p>Yes, <strong>you may use pencils</strong> when answering part 2.</p>
