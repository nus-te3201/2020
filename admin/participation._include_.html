    <ul>
      <li>Alicia earned 1/2, 3/5, <ins>2/5</ins>, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 4/5, 5/5 in the first 12 weeks. As she received at least half of the points in 11 of the weeks, she gets 5 participation marks. Bonus marks are not applicable as she has
        full marks already.</li>
      <li>Benjamin managed to get at least half of the participation points in 9 weeks only, which gives him 5-1 = 4 participation marks. But he received good peer ratings for all criteria, and hence get a bonus mark to make it 5/5.</li>
      <li>Chun Ming met the participation points bar in 8 weeks only, giving him 5-2 = 3 marks. He lost 2 more marks because he received multiple negative ratings for two criteria, giving him 1/5 participation marks.</li>

      <p><strong>Participation marks are available in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRY8YlRUDpFCI2M04Nd_hpt7MXJzc5EnbNIdCZjO3rVhSVHkuLjS03jpL43TGSdILh8HsVshkOX7DFs/pubhtml">this page</a>.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The important column is the <span class="text-monospace"><mark>Weeks Count</mark></span> column. It tells you how many weeks you have met the bar for the criterion <span class="badge badge-info badge-pill">A</span>). Your target is to hit 10 weeks.</li>
        <li>Participation of a week is usually calculated based on two quizzes. For example, week 4 score is calculated based on,
          <ul>
            <li><code>W4-Q1</code>: previous week's (i.e., lecture 3) in-lecture quiz</li>
            <li><code>W4-Q2</code>: previous week's (i.e., lecture 3) post-lecture quiz</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Participation bar for weeks 1-3 have been simplified as follows <span class="dimmed">(to account for late enrollments, LumiNUS problems etc.)</span>:
          <ul>
            <li>Week 1: submitted pre-module survey or pre-lecture quiz</li>
            <li>Week 2: submitted at least one of the quizzes</li>
            <li>Week 3: did reasonably in both quizzes or did well in one of the quizzes</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Quizzes for Week 4 and thereafter are counted as explained in <span class="badge badge-info badge-pill">A</span> above.</li>
