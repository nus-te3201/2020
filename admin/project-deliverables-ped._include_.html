<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The primary objective of the PE is to <mark>increase the rigor of project grading</mark>. Assessing most aspects of the project involves an element subjectivity. As the project counts for 45% of the final grade, it is not prudent to rely on evaluations of tutors alone as there can be significant variations between how different tutors assess projects. That is why we collect more data points via the PE so as to minimize the chance of your project being affected by evaluator-bias.</li>
<li>PE is also <mark>used to evaluate your manual testing skills, product evaluation skills, effort estimation skills</mark> etc.</li>
<li>Note that significant project components are <mark>not graded solely based on peer ratings</mark>. Rather, PE data are mostly used to cross-validate tutors' grades and identify cases that need further investigation. When peer inputs are used for grading, they are usually combined with tutor evaluations with appropriate weight for each. In some cases ratings from team members are given a higher weight compared to ratings from other peers, if that is appropriate.</li>
<li>Note that the PE is <mark>not a means of <em>pitting you against each other</em></mark>. Developers and testers play for the same side; they need to push each other to improve the quality of their work -- not bring down each other.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your performance in the practical exam will affect your final grade and your peers', as explained in <a href="/2020/admin/project-grading.html"><em>Admin: Project Grading</em></a> section.</li>
<li>As such, we have put in measures to identify and <mark>penalize insincere/random evaluations</mark>.</li>

          <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Tuesday midnight</strong>. However, you are recommended to finish this task ASAP, to minimize cutting into

                harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</li>

                    <li>Also note that CATcher hasn't been battle-tested for this phase, in particular, w.r.t. multiple team members editing the same issue concurrently. It is ideal if the team members get together and work through the issues together. If
                      you think others might be editing the same issues at the same time, use the <code>Sync</code> button at the top to force-sync your view with the latest data from GitHub.

          <li>Do <mark><em>system</em> testing first</mark> <span class="dimmed">i.e., does the product work as specified by the documentation?</span>.

          <li>Test <mark>based on the Developer Guide</mark> (Appendix named <em>Instructions for Manual Testing</em>) <mark>and the User Guide</mark>. The testing instructions in the Developer Guide can provide you some guidance but if you follow those instructions
            strictly, you are unlikely to find many bugs. You can deviate from the instructions to probe areas that are more likely to have bugs.</li>

  <li>If you have received bug reports that don't seem to be about your project, do let us know ASAP (email the prof).</li>
  <li>You can navigate to the original bug report (via the back-link provided in the bug report given to you) and post in that issue thread to communicate with the tester who reported the bug <span class="dimmed">e.g. to ask for more info</span>, etc. However,
