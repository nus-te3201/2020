            <p>When working with others, especially in a large class such as TE3201,  it is very important that you adhere to standards, policies, and instructions imposed on everyone. Not doing so creates unnecessary headaches for everyone and puts your
              work attitude in a negative light. That is why we penalize repeated violations of instructions. On the other hand we do understand that humans are liable to make mistakes. That is why we only penalize repeated or frequent mistakes.</p>

            <p><strong>Normally, the prof will respond within 24 hours</strong> if it was an email sent to the prof or a forum post directed at the prof. If you don't get a response within that time, <strong>please feel free to remind the prof</strong>.
              It is likely that the prof did not notice your post or the email got stuck somewhere.</p>

            <panel header="Email etiquette: ALWAYS respond to direct emails" expanded>
              <p>Not responding to a personal email is a major breach of professional etiquette (and general civility). Imagine how pissed off you would be if you met the prof along the corridor, said 'Hi prof, good morning' and the prof walked away without
                saying anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type &quot;Noted. Thanks&quot; and hit 'send'.</p>
              <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to the prof requesting a reference letter and the prof did not respond at all because he/she did not
                want to give you one; You'll be quite frustrated because you wouldn't know whether to look for another prof or wait longer for a response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying nothing is not
                acceptable. If you didn't reply, the sender will not even know whether you received the email.</p>
