    <p><code>Ui.png</code> represents your product in its full glory.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Before taking the screenshot, populate the product with data that makes the product look good. For example,</li>
      <li>If the product is supposed to show photos, use real photos instead of dummy placeholders.</li>
      <li>If the product doesn't have nice line wrapping for long inputs/outputs, don't use such inputs/outputs for the screenshot.</li>
      <li>It should show a state in which the product is well-populated <span class="dimmed">i.e., don't leave data panels largely blank</span></li>
      <li>Choose a state that showcase the main features of the product <span class="dimmed">i.e., the login screen is not usually a good choice</span></li>
      <li>Take a clean screenshot with a decent resolution. Some screenshot tools can capture a specified window only. If your tool cannot do that, make sure you crop away the extraneous parts captured by the screenshot.</li>
      <li>Avoid annotations (arrows, callouts, explanatory text etc.); it should look like the product is in use for real.</li>

  <li><strong>Use a suitable profile photo.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div id="profile-photo" class="indented-level2">
  <p>The purpose of the profile photo is for the teaching team to identify you. Therefore, choose a recent individual photo showing your face clearly (i.e., not too small) -- somewhat similar to a passport photo. Some examples can be seen in the 'Teaching
    team' page. Given below are some examples of good and bad profile photos.<br>
    <img src="/2020/admin/images/profilephotos.png" style="width: 365.33px"></p>
  <p>If you are uncomfortable posting your photo due to security reasons, you can post a lower resolution image so that it is hard for someone to misuse that image for fraudulent purposes. If you are concerned about privacy, you may use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Portrait_placeholder.png">a placeholder image</a>    in place of the photo in module-related documents that are publicly visible.</p>
