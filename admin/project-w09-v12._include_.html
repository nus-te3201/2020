            </h3>
            <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the
              current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>

                <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>Define project tasks as issues</strong>. When you start implementing a user story (or a feature), break it down to smaller tasks if necessary. Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. <mark>Create issues for each</mark> of those
                  tasks so that they can be tracked.<span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>

                  <li>
                    <p>A typical task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks. Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Do not track things taken for granted. <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Write a descriptive title for the issue. <span class="dimmed">e.g. <code>Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser</code></span></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Omit redundant details. In some cases, the issue title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the issue description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal
                        description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.<br><br></li>

              <h4 id="using-milestones">Using Milestones:</h4>
              <p>We recommend you do proper milestone management starting from v1.2. <mark>Given below are the conditions to satisfy for a milestone to be considered properly managed</mark>:</p>
              <p><strong>Planning a Milestone</strong>:<br></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Issues assigned to the milestone, team members assigned to issues</strong>: Used <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/">GitHub milestones</a> to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone
                    by assigning issues to suitable milestones. Also make sure those issues are assigned to team members. <span class="dimmed">Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Deadline set for the milestones</strong> (in the GitHub milestone). <span class="dimmed">Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</span></p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Wrapping up a Milestone</strong>:<br></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>A working product tagged</strong> with the correct tag (e.g. <code>v1.2</code>) and is pushed to the main repo<br> or a <strong>product <em>release</em> done on GitHub</strong>. A product release is optional for v1.2 but required
                    from from v1.3. Click <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases/">here</a> to see an example release.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>All tests passing</strong> on Travis for the version tagged/released.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Milestone updated to match the product</strong> i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone. Incomplete issues/PRs should be moved to a future milestone.<br>

                <li>
                  <p><strong>If necessary, future milestones are revised</strong> based on what you experienced in the current milestone <span class="dimmed">e.g. if you could not finish all issues assigned to the current milestone, it is a sign that you overestimated how much you can do in a week, which means you might want to reduce the issues assigned to future milestones to match that observation</span>.</p>
