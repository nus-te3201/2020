          <p><strong>Tip: Do <em>all</em> the work related to your enhancement yourself.</strong> <span class="dimmed">Reason:If there is no clear division of who did which enhancement, it will be difficult to divide project credit (or assign responsibility for bugs detected by testers) later.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Tip: Divide the components of the product among team members</strong>. Notwithstanding the above, you are still recommended to divide the components of the product among team members so that each team member is <em>in charge</em> of
            one or more components. While others will be modifying those components as necessary for the features they are implementing, your role as the <em>in charge</em> of a component is to guide others modifying that component <span class="dimmed">(reason: you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about that component)</span>            and protect that component from degrading <span class="dimmed">e.g., you can review others' changes to your component and suggest possible changes</span>.</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ¤” How much code to write?</strong> The project grade depends on the value you added, as perceived by evaluators (i.e., team members, peer evaluators, and tutors) as well as other factors such as the quality of the code. As such, there
          is no strong correlation between the LoC and the grade. For instance, in a recent semester, a student who wrote 500 LoC of
          <tooltip content="i.e., excluding test code and documentation">functional code</tooltip> was able to reach top 20% (in terms of project marks), another who wrote 900 LoC reached the top 10%, while another who wrote more than 5000 LoC ended up in the bottom 10%. Also see the the percentiles of functional
          LoC written by that batch of students, given below:</p>
