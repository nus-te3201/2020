{{ icon_important_big_red }} We strongly recommend you to **have a team project meeting _before_ the tutorial**. Do the following during the meeting:
* **Finish the tP tasks allocated for the week.** For example, if you don't have a preliminary project idea by this week's tutorial (as per the tP schedule), the tutor will not be able to give feedback on it.
  * Note that the timeliness of tP tasks (i.e., the deadline is the midnight before the tutorial) is graded under the _project management_ component of the tP. 
  * Keep notes of the meeting, and update project documents -- the tutor will ask for those during the tutorial.
* **Help each other finish iP tasks.** Tasks allocated to this week are especially troublesome and some peer help can be very useful.
* **If you can, do the post-lecture quiz together**; while the deadline for the quiz is Thursday midnight, doing it before the tutorial will help you identify unclear areas, which you can then clarify during the tutorial.
* **Dealing with technical problems**:
